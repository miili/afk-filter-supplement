    "title": "Extended Supplement for De-noising distributed acoustic sensing data using an adaptive frequency-wavenumber filter",
    "description": "This electronical extension presents an adaptive frequency-wavenumber filter suppresses the incoherent seismic noise while amplifying the coherent wave field in seismic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) data. We analyse the response of the filter in time and spectral domain, and we demonstrate its performance on a noisy data set that was recorded in a vertical borehole observatory showing active and passive seismic phase arrivals. In these data we can suppress the noise up to 20 dB. This data publication serves as a repository for data an plotting scripts.",
